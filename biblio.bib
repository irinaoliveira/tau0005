  abstract = {Japan's Ise Shrine is famous for its thirteen-hundred-year-old reconstruction tradition, the Shikinen sengu, in which the most sacred structures are completely rebuilt every twenty years. The construction process incorporates not only the usual elements of planning, materials procurement, and installation, but also integrates some thirty Shinto rituals that mark important milestones in the construction process. This renewal is remarkable because it preserves an ancient architectural style that is extremely susceptible to decay as well as the ancient construction technologies needed to build it. Because each cycle is very closely modeled on its predecessor, the most recent reconstruction, completed in 1993, provides a window through which we can examine ancient construction attitudes and technologies.},

This paper examines both the prospects and problems involved in using this technology to map the development of urban form. Using a computer model of Cairo in two different periods of the Middle Ages, the author has attempted to reconstruct the physical reality of the city and to animate the city so that modern-day observers may experience its principal streets. While the work has shown computer simulation to be a significant tool for helping urban historians understand the built environments of the past, it has also exposed possible pitfalls in the seductive potential of such simulations.},

In this article I address some of the new challenges that architectural history faces today and contemplate two questions with important implications for teaching survey courses. First, how does one make architectural history less Eurocentric and more cross-cultural without either naturalizing the cultural difference of "others" or essentializing these differences into incommensurable categories? Second, how does one talk about the politics of architecture without reducing architecture to politics?},

Assembled here for the first time, these offer an insightful overview of the subject, ranging from the earliest mosques and tombs erected by the Delhi sultans in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, to the great monuments of the Mughal emperors dating from the 16th and 17th centuries. The articles cover the principal forms of Indian Islamic architecture -- mosques, tombs, minarets, forts, gateways and water structures -- as well as the most important sites and their monuments. Unsurpassed for their compression of information, these succinct articles serve as the best possible introduction to the subject, indispensible for both students and travellers. The articles are supplemented by a portfolio of photographs especially selected for the volume, as well as a glossary and up to date bibliography.},

The earliest cities were loci of the royal lineages, which were the apex of the newly created class structure. The basic exploitative technology underwent little change from the Neolithic to the Shang, and the emergence of the great Shang civilization was based on a reorganized distribution of wealth, which enabled the concentration of society's resources in the hands of the ruling class. Ironically, while much of the greatest material achievement in Shang civilization - or perhaps any civilization - is wasteful in terms of human needs, in posterity such achievements honour all the people they represent, the ruler and the ruled. Is greatness possible only in such terms, or are the archaeologist's criteria for greatness cockeyed in the first place?},

  abstract = {This paper offers a history of rammed-earth construction through the study of selected examples of Islamic defensive architecture in Spain. While earth construction differs from region to region and time to time during the period of Islamic domination in Spain, various examples share a number of common characteristics. The details of rammed-earth construction techniques in each historical epoch are analysed in terms of the dimensions of the earth boxes and their elements. The processes and the auxiliary elements of the formwork, and the role of putlog holes and beams are also studied. From this analysis a construction typology for Islamic earthworks is proposed. This differs from Medieval Christian rammed-earth construction which comprises a method using boxes and half putlogs which need a bracing system such as wedges, nails, ropes or Saint Andrew crosses. Finally, analysis of the modules and dimensions of the rammed-earth components reveals that two modules were used, one used during Emirate and Caliphate based on a dimension of a raššāší cubit (0.55 cm), the other used during the Almoravid, Almohad and Nasrid kingdoms based on a dimension of a ma’mūní cubit (c. 0.45 cm)..},

Six of China's greatest architectural historians have joined with a leading Western scholar to write this book, the first in-depth, collaborative history of Chinese architecture in more than fifty years."

Each chapter includes sections on cities, palaces, religious architecture, tombs, and gardens as well as discussions of bridges, walls, fortifications, academics, and architectural writings." "Amply enhanced with more than 300 color photographs and exquisite drawings - many of which are reproduced here for the first time - and also featuring maps, charts, and an index with Chinese terms, the book will be an invaluable resource for scholars of China and everyone interested in one of the world's greatest architectural traditions.},

The nation's architectural achievements range from its earliest walled cities and the First Emperor's vision of city and empire, to bridges, pagodas, and the twentieth-century constructions of the Socialist state. In this beautifully illustrated book, Nancy Shatzman Steinhardt presents the first fully comprehensive survey of Chinese architecture in any language. With rich political and historical context, Steinhardt covers forty centuries of architecture, from the genesis of Chinese building through to the twenty-first century and the challenges of urban expansion and globalism. Steinhardt follows the extraordinary breadth of China's architectural legacy--including excavation sites, gardens, guild halls, and relief sculpture--and considers the influence of Chinese architecture on Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and Tibet. Architectural examples from Chinese ethnic populations and various religions are examined, such as monasteries, mosques, observatories, and tombs. Steinhardt also shows that Chinese architecture is united by a standardized system of construction, applicable whether buildings are temples, imperial palaces, or shrines. Every architectural type is based on the models that came before it, and principles established centuries earlier dictate building practices. China's unique system has allowed its built environment to stand as a profound symbol of Chinese culture},
